# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the failing GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline checks for the Interview Prep AI application. The current pipeline has multiple failing checks including test failures and deployment issues that need to be resolved to ensure reliable continuous integration and deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to pass all checks, so that I can confidently deploy code changes to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN all GitHub Actions checks SHALL pass successfully
2. WHEN tests are run in CI THEN they SHALL complete without failures or timeouts
3. WHEN the security scan runs THEN it SHALL not report any vulnerabilities
4. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL complete successfully for both Node.js 18.x and 20.x

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable test execution in CI, so that I can trust the test results and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN they SHALL run within reasonable time limits (under 2 minutes)
2. WHEN test mocks are used THEN they SHALL be properly configured to avoid import/module errors
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the failure messages SHALL be clear and actionable
4. WHEN tests pass locally THEN they SHALL also pass in the CI environment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want successful deployment workflows, so that new features can be automatically deployed to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment to Vercel is triggered THEN it SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN they SHALL be properly configured in GitHub Secrets
3. WHEN the build artifacts are created THEN they SHALL be valid and deployable
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN the error messages SHALL provide clear debugging information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code quality checks, so that the codebase maintains high standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linting is enabled THEN it SHALL not block CI with excessive errors
2. WHEN code formatting is applied THEN it SHALL be consistent across the project
3. WHEN new code is added THEN it SHALL meet the established quality standards
4. WHEN quality checks fail THEN they SHALL provide specific guidance for fixes
